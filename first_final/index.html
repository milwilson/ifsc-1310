    <h1>CONCEPT CENTAUR</h1>

    <p>
        Like the mythical half-horse, half-man of Greek lore, Concept Centaur combines the best of several technologies to create an innovative whole. The result of exploration by Segway Inc.'s product development team, Concept Centaur will challenge the way you think about four-wheeled transportation.
        <br>
        <br>
        From time to time Segway's product development team devotes days, or even weeks, to creating new product concepts with the goal of finding a prince among frogs. It's a product exploration process they call <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/products-need-kiss-lot-frogs-find-prince-art-science-paras-aggarwal">"frog kissing."</a> During this time, engineers and designers are encouraged to use any available materials in a very short time frame to prove a concept will work.
        <br>
        <br>
        The product development team demonstrated that Concept Centaur was a princeâ€”a concept that passed this initial feasibility test, but is not yet ready to become a product. Concept Centaur demonstrates Segway's continued commitment to breakthrough innovation and the innumerable possibilities for the future of personal transportation.

    <h2>WHAT IS THE CENTAUR?</h2>

    <div class="side-by-side">

        <p>
            Concept Centaur combines proprietary dynamic stabilization technology with advanced propulsion and suspension systems, and an intuitive user interface to create a unique four-wheel device that is easily controllable on two or four wheels. Its full suspension and aggressive rider positioning provide an exhilarating ride for one or two people while maintaining control over a variety of terrain. Its rugged performance, zero emissions, and quiet operation make it a good low-impact way to explore the world. Its power and versatility make it suitable for a variety of indoor and outdoor recreational and commercial applications.

            <div class="ul-text">
                <strong>Thumbs forward:</strong> The Centaur's forward and backward propulsion is easily controlled by pushing a thumb throttle located on the underside of the right-hand handlebar.

        <li>
            <div class="ul-text">
                <strong>Pop a wheelie:</strong> The Centaur uses dynamic stabilization technology to limit and/or maintain the angle at which the rider experiences the device.

                <div class="p">
                    <strong>No exhaust:</strong> Batteries power the Centaur, so there are no emissions during operation. In addition, the Centaur uses regenerative braking, which means the batteries are recharged during deceleration and hill descents.

                <div class="p">
                    <strong>Low-impact tires:</strong> The Centaur prototypes use the same non-marking silica-based tires as the Segway PTs'. These tires are smooth, which allows the rider to perform exciting maneuvers while having little impact on the terrain.

    <h3>Distinctive design, elegant suspension:</h3>

                <img src="img/cross-profile.jpg" alt="a side view of the Centaur's infamous x profile">
                <div class="p">
                    <strong>A profile X-shape:</strong> The profile of the Centaur creates an "X." Right after the Centaur was crowned a prince by the engineers, they quickly pulled in Segway's industrial design team to integrate their vision into the product's form and function.
                </div>

                <div class="p">
                    <strong>Three shocks:</strong> There are three shocks on the Centaur that absorb bumps and help the wheels maintain contact with the ground. There is one in each front "arm" and one in the rear.
                </div>
            </div>

                <img src="img/lightweight.jpg" alt="A picture of the electric engine">
                <div class="p">
                    <strong>Lightweight:</strong> Concept Centaur only weighs about 150 pounds and can be easily transported in the back of a large SUV or small pick-up truck. If developed, its light weight would allow for transport on the back of small cars through a hitch-mounted rack, similar to that used for carrying bicycles.
