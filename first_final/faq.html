  <section>
    <h2>How fast does it go?</h2>
    <p>Concept Centaur prototypes have gone just over 20 miles per hour. If Concept Centaur were to be manufactured in the future, more testing would be required to determine the appropriate top speed.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
    <p>Since Concept Centaur is just that—a concept—they aren't for sale. At the present time, Segway Inc. has no plans to manufacture or sell this as a product.</p>
